# Password Generator Starter Code
In this assignment i made a project that will generate random code.

It will generate random code by first setting arrays for each of users response.
Then created a an empty array to hold all the inouts from the prompts
Made the prompts to best fit the criteria.
Then concatenated users responses into the empty array i made at top.
At the end made a for loop to generate randoms until i is greater than the users input for how much they want the passowrd length to be.
Then created another for loop that will add them togeather and finnaly displayed the final result in the alert window.
